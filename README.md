This App is like your books list. You can add books with ganre, your score, author then you can sort your list as you like. You can also edit your entry.
Every book is saved on your local storage, so don't worry about refreshing page :) 
Sounds simple, but i am not used to work on such things without react so it was challenge for me. 

I also tried webpack to wrap js file, which happened to be bigger than i expected.
